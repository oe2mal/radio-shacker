Sometimes it is not easy to find an application 
which can do simple stupid work.

For example: 
watching some computers, if they are online ore not.
This can be done by a ping to each machine.

But if there are 20 or more machines to be pinged,
this could be a quite stupid work.
Open 20 or more terminals with just one ping inside, can not be the solution.
It is not easy to monitor this terminals. 

Simple to write a short app which do this job is the better way.
One terminal, one app, Input: the addresses of the machines to be watched. 
One output for each machine and one output for all machines, if they are online. 

For such cases I would like to fill up this repository.
to make life as easy as possible.

For education, hobby, work and other interests....
